COMPONENTS OF THE SAVANT PROJECT
--------------------------------

The Intermediate Form
---------------------


Savant uses the Advanced Intermediate Representation with Extensibility/Common Enviorment
(AIRE/CE).  It is defined as an object-oriented data structure, and has been developed
jointly with FTL Systems.  Documentation for the basic AIRE/CE classes can be found at:
http://www.ftlsystems.com/reprint.html

SCRAM: A VHDL Analyzer
----------------------

The SCRAM analyze will input a VHDL description, check it for syntactic and static
semantic correctness, and store in memory it in the intermediate form (IF).  The SCRAM
parser is constructed as an LL(2) grammar and using the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool
Set (PCCTS) parser generator (many thanks to Terence Parr, Hank Dietz, and Will Cohen).
SCRAM is written in C++.


Transmute: Derived Classes that Implement Static Equivalences
-------------------------------------------------------------

The transmute method is a collection of derived classes that support rewriting of the IF
into a reduced form.  More precisely, these classes implement the static model reduction
algebra defined in the UC RASSP formal modeling project.  Example reductions are the
rewriting of a concurrent call statement into the equivalent process statement containing
sequential call and wait statements.  These classes produce a reduced form IF against
which back-end CAD tools can operate.


Publisher: Derived Classes for Output Generation
------------------------------------------------

Output generation in the SAVANT software suite is supported by the collection of publisher
classes.  Two overloaded methods, publish_vhdl() and publish_cc(), are defined for all
nodes of the reduced IF.  The publish_vhdl() method simply regenerates VHDL from the
internal IF.  The publish_cc() method produces c++ simulation code to link with the TyVIS
simulation kernel.

The Library Manager
-------------------

The ability of separating a VHDL description into separate independent libraries
necessitate the existence of a library manager. As specified by the VHDL language
reference manual (LRM) (chapter 11), parts of a VHDL description can be separately
compiled into a library and accessed in other parts of the VHDL description. The library
manager has been designed to take care of this functionality. It allows the user to create
design libraries and helps the parser locate design libraries that are referenced in other
VHDL descriptions.
